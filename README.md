A simple millisecond accurate clock display.

This is a progressive web app (PWA) that can be installed on your device.

> Why did I make this?

I am really annoyed that iOS clock doesn't have a seconds display and wanted to whip something up to make it easier to see the time. I also have a few mechanical watches that I need to set regularly and wanted to make it easier to see the time.
